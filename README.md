# Docker environment setup for robotics simulation  

This repo contains a Dockerfile and a docker-compose file to set a development environment suitable for development of robotics projects consisting of simulation.  
It is based on the latest ROS Jazzy Desktop Docker image and is configured to run GUI programs like Gazebo for running simulations.  
It also works on Wayland as tested on Fedora 40 KDE Spin running the Plasma Wayland session.
